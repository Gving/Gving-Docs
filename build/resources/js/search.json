A percentage of each transaction is allocated to a multi-signature wallet which is used to give back to charitable organizations decided by the community through a voting system on our Dapp. Cryptocurrencies are an attractive asset to donate due to decentralisation providing remote aid through a robust and stable payment solution.","Gving revolves around the community through a rewarding technology implemented to give back to the holders of the community, and give holders a voice through hosting community polls to determine what charitable organizations receive contributions.","Gving provides a growing decentralized gaming site hosted on the Polygon chain, providing lightning fast transaction speeds. Holders can wager their tokens and play luck based games to further enhance volume of the token whilst contributing to charity donations.","The Gving token features a cryptocurrency mechanism known as reflections to give back to our holders. Just by holding $GVG you will receive passive reflections in a token tethered to the US Dollar, making this passive income immune to crypto market fluctuations."]}],[{"l":"Tokenomics","p":["Tokenomics are split into 5 categories as shown below:","A part of each transaction is donated to charities based on community polls.

From a marketing, infrastructure and funding perspective, both chains will receive the exact same amount of attention and care from the Gving Core Team. With that being said, both chains have slight advantageous nuances that are worth being made aware of. The BNB Chain is more commonly used for interacting with tokens and is thus expected to have higher volumes and therefore higher reflections. The Polygon Network, on the other hand, will benefit from an increase in wallet-to-wallet transactions due to our game system. This will thus increase the amount of reflections that are given to GVG holders on the Polygon Network. Furthermore, whilst not as popular as the BNB Chain for token interaction, the Gving Core Team feel the Polygon Network has a lot of potential and could result in a lot more transaction volume in the future."]},{"i":"what-will-the-difference-in-gvgs-price-be-for-both-blockchains","l":"What will the difference in $GVG's price be for both blockchains?","p":["A presale will be held on the Polygon Network, and after this, the LP will be split equally between both the BNB Chain and the Polygon Network.

A major obstacle of this was both the speed of the transactions and the gas fees for making the transaction.

We've put aside 50% of all tokenomics coming from buys/sells and transfers to give back to the world. The 5% set to reflections is made to increase incentive of buying the token, which has a great impact on the price and volume. This results in the 2% for charity gaining more value than it would if the entire 7% was set to charity as no incentive would be provided to the holders."]}],[{"l":"Miscellaneous"},{"i":"where-can-i-find-gvings-latest-announcements-and-updates","l":"Where can I find Gving's latest announcements and updates?","p":["The best source of information for Gving updates is through our official discord, telegram and twitter All social media links are found in the next page."]}],[{"l":"Official Links","p":["Website","Discord","Telegram","Reddit","Facebook","Twitter","Instagram","TikTok","LinkedIn"]}]]
