# Disclaimer
Please consider the following risk factors (many of which are specific and inherent to cryptographic tokens) before using any part of our Website/platforms and before purchasing and/or trading Gving cryptographic tokens or any other cryptographic token which we (or any third-party service provider accessed through our platform) may offer through our Website/platforms from time to time (“ tokens”). The value of the tokens as well as your ability to access and transfer the tokens could be materially and adversely affected if any of these risk factors materialise. As a result, when you purchase tokens you expose yourself to considerable risk and potential financial losses.
Please also note that this Risk Statement is not exhaustive. You should carry out further research (and seek professional advice) to carefully determine whether purchasing and/or trading tokens is suitable for your particular financial situation and risk tolerance.
Tokens are high-risk assets and should never use funds that you cannot afford to lose to purchase them.

1. Price Volatility
The price of tokens can be subject to dramatic fluctuations and high volatility due to the rapid shifts in offer and demand resulting from events such as but not limited to: (a) good or bad publicity, (b) changes in the financial technology industry, (c) technological advancement, (d) market trends, (e) general economic and/or political conditions, (f) degree of adoption, (g) degree of institutional support, (h) regulatory measures, (i) degree of government support, (l) market dynamics, (m) trading activities, (n) hacking, and (o) events affecting large service providers, including exchanges.
As a result of price volatility, your tokens may lose all value and become worthless. We shall not be responsible for any loss incurred by you as a result of the inherent price-volatility of tokens.

2. Laws/Regulations
The legal and/or regulatory framework surrounding tokens and distributed ledger technology is uncertain, not harmonised, and unsettled in many jurisdictions.
It is difficult to predict what framework will become applicable to tokens in the near future and how the implementation of dedicated legal and/or regulatory frameworks will affect the price of tokens. A newly introduced legal and regulatory framework may interfere with or otherwise limit your ability to hold or dispose of your tokens, which in turn could result in a financial loss on your part.
As a result, we are not responsible for any loss which you may suffer as a result of any newly introduced legal and/or regulatory framework.

3. UNANTICIPATED RISKS
In addition to the risks included in this document, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding, trading, and use of tokens, some of which we cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this section. This statement is not exhaustive and shall not be taken to consider all risks involved in tokens and cryptocurrencies.
Gving is not responsible for any loss which you may suffer as a result of unanticipated risks.

4. Taxation
The tax characterisation of tokens is complex and largely uncertain. The uncertainty in the tax treatment of tokens may expose you to unforeseen future tax consequences associated with purchasing, owning, selling or otherwise using tokens. You should seek tax advice to understand what tax obligations apply to you when purchasing, holding, transferring, and utilising tokens. Failure to comply with your tax obligations could result in severe fines and even jail time.
