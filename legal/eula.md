By clicking "Sign Up" or connecting to and/or using the Gving Games software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.

If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not interact with or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.

This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by Gving herewith regardless of whether other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Gving Games updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.
