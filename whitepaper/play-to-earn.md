# Play to Earn

Our Play to Earn (P2E) app consists of luck-based games where players can wager $GVG tokens against other players. 
The app is accessible through our website and allows for a complete Web 3 gaming experience.


The Polygon network is used for our gaming functionality to achieve a fully decentralized experience. The Polygon network has near instantaneous 
transaction speeds with minimal gas fees which makes it the perfect solution for our P2E app!


Our leaderboard provides full anonymity whilst allowing our community to actively compete and engage with one another. As users play our games and 
compete in our tournaments and events, they will obtain XP, levels and unique rewards that will include cosmetics, perks and boosts.
