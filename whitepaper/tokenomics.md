# Tokenomics
!!!primary
Tokenomics are split into 5 categories as shown below:
!!!
||| 1. Charity Wallet :innocent:
A part of each transaction is donated to charities based on community polls. More information on charity voting and the
reasoning behind the specific percentage allocation of charity is explained in the knowledge base [here](https://docs.gving.com/knowledge-base/charity/).
|||
||| 2. Buy Back and Burn :fire:
A part of each transaction is used to buy more $GVG and is sent to a burn wallet forever. This reduces the supply, making $GVG scarcer. This can lead to an increase in price and benefits investors.
|||
||| 3. Liquidity Pool :swimmer:
A part of each transaction is added to the liquidity pool to further ensure the stability of the token.
||| 
||| 4. Community Reflections :gem:
A part of each transaction is redistributed to all token holders in the form of either BUSD if holding on the BNB Chain or USDC if holding on the Polygon Network.
|||
||| 5. Use Wallet :gear:
A part of swap transactions are reinvested into growing, improving, and marketing the project.
