# Tokenomics
!!!primary
Tokenomics are split into 5 categories as shown below:
!!!
||| 1. Charity Wallet :innocent:
A part of each transaction is donated to charities based on community polls.
|||
||| 2. Buy Back and Burn :fire:
A part of each transaction is used to buy more $GVG and is sent to a burn wallet forever. This reduces the supply, making $GVG scarcer. This can lead to an increase in price and benefits investors.
|||
||| 3. Liquidity Pool :swimmer:
A part of each transaction is added to the liquidity pool to ensure stability of the token.
||| 
||| 4. Community Reflections :gem:
A part of each transaction is redistributed to token holders in the form of either BUSD or USDC depending on the chain.
|||
||| 5. Use Wallet :gear:
A part of swap transactions are reinvested into growing and improving the project.
