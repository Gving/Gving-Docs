==- What chain is Gving ($GVG) built on?
Gving is built on both the Polygon chain and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), however our online staking games utilise the Gving on the Polygon chain.
==- What's the difference between $GVG on the Polygon chain and on the BSC?
Owning $GVG tokens on the Polygon chain allows you to participate in Gving's online staking games. Owning on the Polygon chain produces reflections in the form of USDC on the Polygon chain. Owning on the BSC produces reflections in the form of BUSD on BSC.
==- Why do the online staking games utilize the Polygon chain instead of the BSC?
Our goal to produce a fully decentralized gaming site required us to have all game related events & interactions handled by a blockchain. A major obstacle of this was both the speed of the transactions and the gas fees for making the transaction.. On the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), it can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes for a transaction to complete, with transaction costs of around a few cents. However, on the Polygon chain, transaction speeds are almost instantaneous and gas fees going as low as a fraction of a cent.
==- Is it better to purchase $GVG on BSC or Polygon?
Deciding which token to purchase depends on the user. From a marketing, infrastructure and funding perspective, both tokens will receive the exact same amount of attention and care from the Gving Core Team. With that being said, both chains have slight advantageous nuances that are worth being made aware of. BSC is more commonly used for interacting with tokens and is thus expected to have higher volumes and therefore higher reflections. The Polygon chain, on the other hand, will benefit from an increase in wallet-to-wallet transactions due to our game system. This will thus increase the amount of reflections that are given to GVG holders on the Polygon chain. Furthermore, whilst not as popular as BSC for token interaction, the Gving Core Team feel Polygon has a lot of potential and could result in a lot more transaction volume in the future.
==- What will the difference in $GVG's price be for both blockchains?
A presale will be held on the Polygon blockchain, and after this, the LP will be split into both the BSC and the Polygon chain.. Arbitrage will provide a way for users to gain more for their investment, whilst maintaining similar pricess of the token on both chains.
