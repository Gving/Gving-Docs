### What chain is Gving ($GVG) built on?
Gving's main blockchain is the Polygon Network, however a 1:1 swap feature is available between the $GVG on the Polygon Network and the $GVG on the BNB Chain

### What's the difference between $GVG on the Polygon Network and on the BNB Chain?
Owning $GVG tokens on the Polygon Network allows you to participate in Gving's online staking games. Owning on the Polygon Network produces reflections in the form of USDC.
 Owning on the BNB Chain produces reflections in the form of BUSD on their relative chains.

### Is it better to purchase $GVG on the BNB Chain or the Polygon Network?
Deciding which token to purchase depends on the user. From a marketing, infrastructure and funding perspective, both chains will receive the exact same amount of attention and 
care from the Gving Core Team. With that being said, both chains have slight advantageous nuances that are worth being made aware of. The BNB Chain is more commonly used for interacting with 
tokens and is thus expected to have higher volumes and therefore higher reflections. The Polygon Network, on the other hand, will benefit from an increase in wallet-to-wallet transactions 
due to our game system. This will thus increase the amount of reflections that are given to GVG holders on the Polygon Network. Furthermore, whilst not as popular as the BNB Chain for 
token interaction, the Gving Core Team feel the Polygon Network has a lot of potential and could result in a lot more transaction volume in the future.

### What will the difference in $GVG's price be for both blockchains?
A presale will be held on the Polygon Network, and after this, the LP will be split equally between both the BNB Chain and the Polygon Network. Arbitrage will provide a way for users to gain 
more for their investment, whilst maintaining similar pricess of the token on both chains.
