### Why do the online staking games utilize the Polygon Network instead of the BSC?
Our goal to produce a fully decentralized gaming site required us to have all game related events & interactions handled by a blockchain. A major obstacle of this was both the 
speed of the transactions and the gas fees for making the transaction. On the BNB Chain, it can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes for a transaction 
to complete, with relatively high transaction costs. However, on the Polygon Network, transaction speeds are near instantaneous and minimal gas fees.
